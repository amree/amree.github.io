title: Renaming Author in Git

Recently, I noticed that there are other authors with a different name in my
Git's history. Apparently, I've accidentally committed into the repository using
a different author's name and email. This is mainly due to the way Netbeans
stores author's information history.

So, in order to fix it, I ran this little script from Github in my master
branch.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

git filter-branch --env-filter '

an="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
am="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
cn="$GIT_COMMITTER_NAME"
cm="$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL"

if [ "$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL" = "your@email.to.match" ]
then
    cn="Your New Committer Name"
    cm="Your New Committer Email"
fi
if [ "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" = "your@email.to.match" ]
then
    an="Your New Author Name"
    am="Your New Author Email"
fi

export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="$an"
export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="$am"
export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$cn"
export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$cm"
'
```

To push it into the server, I need to use `git push -f` instead of `git push`.
If you use the latter command, you'll end up with a merged history (every
commit will have another one identical to it).

If you use Redmine, you may need to fetch change set. Just run this command in
your Redmine's directory:

```text
script/runner "Repository.fetch_changesets" -e production
```

Netbeans committer's info are stored in (change the path based on your version):

```text
~/.netbeans/7.0/config/Preferences/org/netbeans/modules/git.properties
```
