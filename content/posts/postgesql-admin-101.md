PostgreSQL has always been one of my daily tools that gets the least attention,
yet somehow it manages to consume a lot of my time due to my lack of proper
understanding of how it works behind the scenes.

I decided to improve this situation by learning PostgreSQL from the perspective
of an admin in 2025. This post was originally written on X, but I decided to
move it to a blog since it was becoming troublesome to search and keep track of
what I had written. I've bookmarked all the original threads in this
[gist](https://gist.github.com/amree/e0b2e0d8ea6c78dadb837fbbf83d19f3).

This post is expected to be quite long since it combines multiple posts written
over several months. Alright, let's get into it.
